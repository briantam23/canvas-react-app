### Installation

* `npm install` ( or `yarn install` )
* `npm run start:dev`
* open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a web browser

The `run start:dev` command will run both the `webpack` process (in watch mode) to build your client-side Javascript files, and the Node process for your server with `nodemon`.
